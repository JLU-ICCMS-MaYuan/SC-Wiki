    {
      year: 1913,
      name: 'Heike Kamerlingh Onnes',
      title: 'Liquefaction of helium and the discovery of superconductivity',
      feat: 'In 1908 Onnes first liquefied helium (boiling point 4.2 K); in 1911 he found that mercury\'s resistance suddenly dropped to zero at 4.2 K — the first observation of superconductivity. This not only proved a new state of matter at extremely low temperatures, but also opened a century of superconductivity research. Onnes wrote "Mercury practically zero" in his notebook, a moment engraved in the history of physics.',

    {
      year: 1972,
      name: 'John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, John Schrieffer',
      title: 'The BCS microscopic theory of superconductivity',
      feat: 'In 1957 the three proposed the BCS theory, the first complete quantum-mechanical microscopic explanation of superconductivity: electrons exchange lattice vibrations (phonons) to form Cooper pairs that move in a macroscopic quantum state without resistance. Bardeen remains the only person to have won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice (first in 1956, for the transistor). The BCS theory is still one of the most important cornerstones of condensed matter physics.',

    {
      year: 1973,
      name: 'Leo Esaki, Ivar Giaever, Brian Josephson',
      title: 'Tunneling in semiconductors and superconductors',
      feat: 'Esaki discovered electron tunneling in semiconductors in 1957 (the Esaki diode); Giaever experimentally verified single-electron tunneling in superconductors in 1960; and Josephson, then a 22-year-old graduate student, predicted the tunneling of Cooper pairs across superconducting junctions — the famous Josephson effect. The prediction was later confirmed with high precision (error < 10⁻¹²) and became the physical basis of superconducting electronics, SQUID magnetometers and voltage standards.',

    {
      year: 1987,
      name: 'Georg Bednorz, Alex Müller',
      title: 'Breakthrough of cuprate high-temperature superconductors',
      feat: 'In 1986, Bednorz and Müller at IBM Zurich discovered 35 K superconductivity in the lanthanum barium copper oxide (LaBaCuO) ceramic, breaking the 23 K record held by Nb₃Ge for 13 years. More importantly, this oxide ceramic was a new type of superconductor that conventional BCS theory could not explain. The discovery triggered a global "superconductivity gold rush"; Ching-Wu Chu and Zhongxian Zhao soon pushed Tc above the liquid-nitrogen regime (77 K), dramatically lowering the cost of superconducting applications and reshaping the industry.',

    {
      year: 2003,
      name: 'Alexei Abrikosov, Vitaly Ginzburg, Anthony Leggett',
      title: 'Type-II superconductors and the theory of superfluidity',
      feat: 'Ginzburg and Landau proposed the phenomenological theory of superconducting phase transitions (GL theory) in 1950, describing the macroscopic wavefunction of the superconducting state. In 1957 Abrikosov predicted the magnetic flux vortex lattice in type-II superconductors — the famous Abrikosov vortices — which directly explains how practical superconducting magnets (MRI, particle accelerators) work in high fields. Leggett shared the prize for his theoretical work on superfluid ³He. Together, the three laid the theoretical foundations of modern superconducting applications.',
